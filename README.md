 1 teaspoon baking soda
 2 Tablespoons (10g) unsweetened natural cocoa powder
 1/2 teaspoon salt
 1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
 2 cups (400g) granulated sugar
 1 cup (240ml) canola or vegetable oil

Red velvet cake has an acidic taste that comes from the use of buttermilk and vinegar as well as the cream cheese in the frosting. The acidity is balanced out by the sweetness of the cake itself. It also has cocoa powder added to it for a mild chocolate flavoring.
